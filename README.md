## SVG Character Editor & Game Engine
An attempt to build a purely SVG-based lightweight game engine running in the browser. 
Based on React and SVG.js, this engine so far features a character editor which allows for a very dynamic generation of 2D characters based on the manipulation of individual SVG properties. 
It also features procedural animation using SVG transforms, animation and DOM manipulation. As a proof-of-concept, a simple 2D MMORPG using this engine is currently in progress.
